Perfect! Given your learning goals and current setup, here's my prioritized roadmap to make this enterprise-level:

**Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 weeks):**

**1. Security & Data Protection**
- Implement database encryption at rest (PostgreSQL TDE or application-level encryption)
- Add field-level encryption for sensitive document content using AES-256
- Implement proper secret management (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)
- Add document access audit logging
- Consider document retention policies and secure deletion

**2. Observability Foundation**
- Add structured logging with correlation IDs across all modules (Logback with JSON)
- Implement distributed tracing (Micrometer Tracing with Zipkin)
- Add comprehensive metrics (Micrometer + Prometheus)
- Create health checks for all external dependencies (OCR, LLM, DB)

**Medium Term (1-2 months):**

**3. Architecture Improvements**
- Make OCR processing asynchronous too - current sync approach will break under load
- Implement proper event-driven architecture (consider Spring Cloud Stream or direct message broker)
- Add circuit breakers for external calls (Resilience4j)
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

**4. Testing Strategy**
- Achieve 80%+ code coverage with meaningful unit tests
- Add integration tests using Testcontainers for real database/message broker testing
- Implement contract testing between modules (Spring Cloud Contract)
- Add performance/load testing (JMeter or Gatling)

A few questions to refine the approach:
- Are you open to adding a message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for better async processing?
- Do you want to stick with local deployment or move to cloud for learning?
- What's your budget for tools/services?

Should I elaborate on any of these areas first?
