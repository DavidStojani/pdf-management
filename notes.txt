added the user registration and login throught rest.

__ App scans for new files in the given folders__
      * in each start it scans for new files in the given folders
      * the files are added to the correct user
  -- to clarify what will happen :
  the user logs in in the web browser(rest) and has the option to give a local folder over rest.
  this path of the folder will be saved for this user.
  this folder will be scanned for pdf files.
  The pdf files found will be stored and proccesed as already in the upload function.



  -- There should be a way to not iterate strategies. also here after a strategy returns text than we need to clean it. Q: when else will the text be cleaned ?

1-  I clean the text that i read from ocr
2-  I clean the text that i get as response from ollama
3-  I clean the processed response of ollama to get just one json
