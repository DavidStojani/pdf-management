added the user registration and login throught rest.

__ App scans for new files in the given folders__
      * in each start it scans for new files in the given folders
      * the files are added to the correct user
  -- to clarify what will happen :
  the user logs in in the web browser(rest) and has the option to give a local folder over rest.
  this path of the folder will be saved for this user.
  this folder will be scanned for pdf files.
  The pdf files found will be stored and proccesed as already in the upload function.



  -- There should be a way to not iterate strategies. also here after a strategy returns text than we need to clean it.
  Q: when else will the text be cleaned ?
1-  I clean the text that i read from ocr
2-  I clean the text that i get as response from ollama
3-  I clean the processed response of ollama to get just one json


-----------------------SEARCH OPTIONS----------------------------
1. üîç Text-based Full-Text Search

        Search in whole document text and title.

Tech options:

    PostgreSQL full-text search (tsvector, to_tsvector, GIN indexes).

    Add Elasticsearch (best for large-scale and flexible text queries).

    Leverage vector embeddings if you go semantic (see below).
+++AND+++ ////OR////
2. üè∑Ô∏è Tag-Based Filtering (with AND/OR logic)

    Users can select multiple tags (e.g., Invoice, Contract, Health).

    Combine with operators:

        Invoice AND 2023

        Contract OR Policy

3. üìÖ Date Range Search
    Allow filtering by:
        -Upload date
        -Document creation date (if extracted)
        -Last modified / processed
